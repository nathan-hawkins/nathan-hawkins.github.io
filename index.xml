      <description>To commemorate the 75 year anniversary of one of the most popular professional sports leagues in the world, the NBA released their 75 year anniversary team. Like the previous two additions of the list that come every 25 years, the list was filled with names founding fathers of the NBA, players who ran the league during it’s boom in the 80s and 90s, and even current players. But when trying to limit a leagues history to 75 players, there’s always controversy.</description>

      <description>What I witnessed while watching the Green Bay Packers on Sundays in 2020 was truly special.

Above all of that, I watched quarterback Aaron Rodgers dice up the field he was Gordon Ramsay in Hell’s Kitchen.</description>
